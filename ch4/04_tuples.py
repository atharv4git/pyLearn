# creating a tuple using ()
t = (1,2,4,5)

# printing the elements of a tuple
print(t[0])

# cannot update the values of a tuple
# t[0] = 45 : TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

t1 = (1,)   # tuple with single element
# t1 = (1) --> wrong way to defining a tuple with single element
